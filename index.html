    <p>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle,
        first published on 14 October 1892.
        It contains the earliest short stories featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, which had been
        published in twelve monthly issues of The Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. The stories are
        collected in the same sequence, which is not supported by any fictional chronology.The only characters common to
        all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson and all are related in first-person
        narrative from Watson's point of view.</p>
    <p>In general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify, and try to correct, social
        injustices.Holmes is portrayed as offering a new,fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and
        boosted
        the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine,prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next
        set of stories. The first story, "A Scandal in Bohemia",includes the character of Irene Adler,
        who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock
        Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the
        twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking "The Adventure of
        the Speckled Band" as his overall favourite.</p>
